==================
Profile Reference
==================

When UML is used to model things that belong to a specific domain,
it is common to provide **profiles** to extend the base modeling
language (i.e. UML) and offer some *vocabulary* for the target domain:
the **stereotypes**

The result is a **Domain Specific Modeling Language (DSML)**.

In the process of modeling, common basic elements like Packages, Classes,
Attributes and Operations as well as References are used and -- if
applicable -- attributed with a **Stereotypes** from the target domain.
