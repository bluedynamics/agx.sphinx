Setting up AGX Tests
====================

This describes the procedure to get the AGX tests up and running from scratch. 
In this example we build a full Python 2.6 installation to keep the setup clean 
and self-contained. You might want to skip the installation of Python if you 
consider to use an other interpreter of your choice.

1) First we install plain Python 2.6:

$ svn co https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/buildout/bda-naked-pyt
$ cd bda-naked-python
bda-naked-python$ python bootsrtap.py
bda-naked-python$ ./bin/buildout -v
bda-naked-python$ cd ..

2) Then we get the dewvelopment flavour of AGX:

$ svn co https://svn.plone.org/svn/archetypes/AGX/agx.flavour.dev/trunk
$ cd agx.flavour.dev
agx.flavour.dev$ ../bda-naked-python/parts/python/bin/python2.6 bootstrap.py
agx.flavour.dev$ ./bin/buildout -v
agx.flavour.dev$ cd ..

3) What we can do now is we can run the tests:

agx.flavour.dev$ chmod u+x ./bin/testall
agx.flavour.dev$ ./bin/testall
