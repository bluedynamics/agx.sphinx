===================================================
Installing and configuring Eclipse for use with AGX
===================================================

The setup for AGX described here uses Eclipse Galileo.

Installing Eclipse
------------------

Make sure to have an appropriate Java-interpreter on your machine.
Check out `<http://java.sun.com>`_ for details.

Download and the **Galileo** Eclipse Modeling Tools bundle from
`<http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-modeling-tools-includes-incubating-components/galileosr2>`_.

Unpack the downloaded ZIP or tarball to a location of choice. Eclipse should run 
if Java was installed correctly.
::

    /eclipse/install/path/eclipse

Note for GTK Users (Gnome i.e.) - There is a bug in some versions of GTK that
causes certain print backends to hang. Fix it by providing a 2-liner
script as eclipse launcher.
::

    #!/bin/sh
    export GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS=1
    /eclipse/install/path/eclipse -vmargs -XX:+AggressiveHeap

On first startup, eclipse asks you for a workspace location. This is the
location where eclipse projects are.

After defining the workspace eclipse welcome screen comes up. Go ahead for
digging around a little bit or go directly to the workbench (icon on the 
right).

Installing ANTLR
----------------

Open the Update Manager of Eclipse. It is at
:mod:`help` -> :mod:`install new Software...`.

Click the add button, give it name ANTLR, enter the ANTLR update site 
`<http://antlreclipse.sourceforge.net/updates/>`_ as :mod:`location` and klick
ok. Eclipse now fetches the Plug-In information from this location.

Select :mod:`ANTLR UI`, click :mod:`next` and follow the installation
instructions. After installation you'll be asked to restart Eclipse. Do it!

Installing Papyrus
------------------

Eclipse Modeling Tools come along with facilities for drawing UML models.
Anyway we'll use Papyrus for modeling, it's more handy than the shipped tools.

Repeat the installation procedure from above, this time using the Papyrus update
site `<http://www.papyrusuml.org/home/liblocal/docs/updates/papyrus/>`_ and
select :mod:`Papyrus modelling tools`.

Installing Eclipse AGX
----------------------

AGX Ships with an Eclipse plugin for invoking the generator out of the IDE.
The update site for this plugin is at `<http://agx.me/updates/>`_. Install it
using the update manager.

Using PyDev
-----------

PyDev is an Eclipse plugin for Python development and the choice if you
decide to use Eclipse as your Python IDE.

Using it has the advantage of combining modeling, code generation and custom
work on the generated stuff all in the same IDE - hurrah!.

The update site for Pydev is at `<http://pydev.org/updates/>`_.

Using Aptana Studio
-------------------

Aptana Studio is an IDE for building Web-applications and comes along
with HTML, CSS and JavaScript tools and is is a pretty useful extension.

The update site for Aptana is located at
`<http://download.aptana.org/tools/studio/plugin/install/studio>`_.
